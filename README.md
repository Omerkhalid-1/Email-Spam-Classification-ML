# Email-Spam-Classification-ML
This project aims to utilize Python text classification techniques to identify or classify spam emails. By applying suitable algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and J48 on an email dataset, we will determine the accuracy, processing time, and error rate to compare which algorithm performs best for text classification.  
The dataset was collected from Kaggle(Email Spam classification Dataset)  
Then punctuation and "Subject" was removed from the dataset.  
Used Countvectorizer and TF-IDF as part of the preprocessing step, to convert word into numerical repreentation.  
TF-IDF: convert the words into vector based on the frequency of the word.  
Split the data set into 30% testing data and 70% training datatset.  
Then provided the training dataset to NaiveBayesMultinomial model.
