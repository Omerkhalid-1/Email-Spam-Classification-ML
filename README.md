# Email-Spam-Classification-ML
This project aims to utilize Python text classification techniques to identify or classify spam emails. By applying suitable algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and J48 on an email dataset, we will determine the accuracy, processing time, and error rate to compare which algorithm performs best for text classification.
